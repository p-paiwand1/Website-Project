    <p>What do you call the ball in volleyball? A volleyball is a ball used to play indoor volleyball, beach volleyball, or other less common variations of the sport. Volleyballs are round and traditionally consist of eighteen nearly rectangular panels of synthetic or genuine leather, arranged in six identical sections of three panels each, wrapped around a bladder.</p>

    <p>What is the most important volleyball equipment to buy? <br />
      Here is a list of the Volleyball material and equipment that you may need to play with it.
   To play a game of volleyball, participants must have access to a court, a net, several volleyballs, and a pair of poles for attaching the net to the playing surface. Ball pumps are also useful in situations where the balls have lost a decent amount of air and need to be properly inflated. Optional accessories may also be used for convenience and safety purposes.</p>
